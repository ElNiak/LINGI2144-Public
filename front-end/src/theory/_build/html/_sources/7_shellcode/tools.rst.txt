Dedicated tools
---------------

There are many tools and web sites that propose shellcodes [3]_, all
payloads available on dedicated tools have been manually written and of
course tools such as Metasploit.

Metasploit framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Existing tools for shellcode production can be find in ``Metasploit``
and ``msfvenom``. The Metasploit Project is a huge security project that
provides a wide range of payloads and exploits for various platform.
There is many other tools such as ``webfuzzing``, ``torch`` and many
other.


``msfvenom``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``msfvenom`` is one of Metasploit’stools, it is the merge of
``msfpayload`` and ``msfencod``. It offers more than 400 payloads
(``msfvenom -list p``) [4]_

.. literalinclude:: msf.sh
   :language: bash

Bind/Reverse shellcode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One main step of an attack is to take control of the vulnerable system
and then open a backdoor to start **amplification** of the attack. A
**backdoor** can be:

#. A port opened and listening on the vulnerable system: **a bind
   shell**

    :scale: 50%
    :align: center

2. A connection from the vulnerable system to the attacker: **a reverse
   shell**, in most cases, one goes for reverse shell.

``Netcat`` is a tool to establish a connection between two entities

-  On server : ``nc -lvp 444``

-  Client listen : ``nc address 444``

Generate an executable ELF file for a reverse shell code on localhost
port 4444. On server side:

.. literalinclude:: reverse.sh
   :language: bash

.. warning:: **Client must start listening before shell is started, else “segmentation".**
