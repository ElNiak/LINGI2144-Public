MCQ 1: Introduction
*******************

:task_id: lingi2144-1


Question 1. What is security ?
------------------------------

.. question:: security
   :nb_prop: 6
   :nb_pos: 2

   | Choose the right answer to "Security is ..."

   .. positive::

      - the protection against illegal actions against a society or people.
      - armed with IP filtering  to avoid data theft for example.

   .. positive::

      - not quantifiable.

   .. negative::

      - quantifiable with statistics.

   .. negative::

      - protection against illegal actions against a society or people.
      - about checksums for example to ensure data is safe from failure.

   .. negative::

      - protection against fault with unintended consequences.
      - about checksums for example to ensure data is safe from failure.

   .. negative::

      - protection against fault with unintended consequences.
      - armed with IP filtering  to avoid data theft for example.



Question 2. Timeline of an attack
---------------------------------

.. question:: timeline
   :nb_prop: 3
   :nb_pos: 1

   | What proposition is true:

   .. positive::

      - The spy phase is the first one and consist in finding any vulnerability in order to access to a system.
      - Then follow the intrusion where the intruders exploit the vulnerability to get access to the system
      - The last step for the hacker, which is very important, is the elimination of any potential traces just before evading in the wild.

   .. positive::

      - The attack can only be done once the attacker get root access to the system.
      - It for example when an attacker change all the password of the user but before in need to get access to the ``sudo`` command.
      - After that the attacker should cleans all the logs and other traces and disappear.

   .. negative::

      - The spy phase is the first one and consist in finding any vulnerability in order to access to a system.
      - Then follow the intrusion where the intruders exploit the vulnerability to get access to the system
      - Fishing is about hacking password with for example John the riper in the intrusion phase.

   .. negative::

      - Exploit a buffer overflow in a software is about the intrusion in the system
      - Once in the system we can directly launch the attack and then disappear.


Question 3. True or false
-------------------------

.. question:: truefalse
   :nb_prop: 5
   :nb_pos: 2

   | Check the true propositions:

   .. positive::

      - The surface of an attack is the sum of all possible security risk exposures. It can also be explained as the aggregate of all known, unknown, and potential vulnerabilities, and controls across all hardware, software, and network components

   .. positive::

      - The attacker may be motivated by a large range of things, that's why cyber security aims at reducing potential risks without being obstructive with the organisation.

   .. positive::

      - No ultimate protection exist against security vulnerability.

   .. positive::

      - ``nmap`` or Network Mapper is a tool for network discovery and security auditing. It can be used in the spy phase in order to discover web services on the system.

   .. positive::

      - ``wfuzz`` or Web fuzzer is a tool that replaces any reference to the "FUZZ" keyword by the value of a given payload. A payload in Wfuzz is a source of data. This simple concept allows any input to be injected in any field of an HTTP request, allowing to perform complex web security attacks in different web application components such as: parameters, authentication, forms, directories/files, headers, etc.

   .. positive::

      - ``SQLMap`` is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers.

   .. positive::

      - ``Metasploit`` is a security framework that comes with many tools for system exploit and testing. Its tools includes ``nmap`` and many others. It works with a database of information that can be used for hacking.

   .. negative::

      - Safe links are the ultimate protection against malicious user that would like attack us.

   .. negative::

      - ``nmap`` s a tool that replaces any reference to the "FUZZ" keyword by the value of a given payload. A payload in Wfuzz is a source of data. This simple concept allows any input to be injected in any field of an HTTP request, allowing to perform complex web security attacks in different web application components such as: parameters, authentication, forms, directories/files, headers, etc.

   .. negative::

      - ``wfuzz`` is a security framework that comes with many tools for system exploit and testing. Its tools includes ``nmap`` and many others. It works with a database of information that can be used for hacking.

   .. negative::

      - ``SQLMap`` is a tool for network discovery and security auditing. It can be used in the spy phase in order to discover web services on the system.

   .. negative::

      - The surface of an attack is about breaking one or more security attribute in a system.
