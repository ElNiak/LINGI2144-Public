Malware Analysis II
*******************


Malware Analysis
-----------------

**Objective**: Classification of an executable binary as clean or
malicious (+ malware type/family if possible)

-  Always the same principle:

   -  Characterize the malwares you know with signatures

   -  Try to detect it in new files under analyses.

-  Detection process leads to several types of analysis

   -  First one: **static analysis** (read content of the file)

   -  The **signature** is a (combination of) string(s) + static
      properties (features)
